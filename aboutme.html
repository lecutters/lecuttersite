<h1>Rodrigo Guadalupe Miranda</h1>
<p>I am an artist who goes by the name of lecutters. lecutters is a persona that has become more than just a version of myself but rather the aritst that I want to become. It comes from a reference just the way all my work is in a essence referential to pop culture, existentialism, mutlitple personalities, introspection of the self. I choose to try and play with themes that come from how i grew up and the things that have stayed with me as a part of my growth as a human/artist. I choose to try and tackle the things that have hurt me in the past growing up and trying to play with the things that have always been told to be wrong. My work is a journey that tries to emblish as much nostalgia because every moment seems timeless but immediately detteriorates in our brain. </p>
